# EarlyProgramming
Basically an introduction to programming. I frequently write 
this document, but I do not keep a copy of it handy for the 
next time.  This is that copy for next time. 


Hello!  By one way or another, you have found your way to
this page.  More than likely it is because I told you that I
think you may find it useful, but there is a chance that
someone else suggested you check it out.  Either way: Welcome!

My name is Jeremiah and, despite any evidence to the contrary, 
I am not a programmer. Hacker and loudmouth are actually 
probably better names. Either way, I do happen to know a
little bit about a lot of things, and Object Oriented
programming is one of those things that I know a little bit
about a lot of it.

There are many decisions that will need to be made as you 
move towards the path of becoming a programmer, this is just
a tool to help you make those decisions. Understand that this
document is influenced heavily by my own personal experiences, 
prejudices, and exposure to concepts, so please realize that
this is by no means anything except one persons opinions: YMMV.

#Languages

A quick note about "programming languages": When I talk about
programming languages, I am speaking about actual programming
languages. Syntax for stylesheets (css) and markups (HTML, MD)
are things that you should have an idea about as they will
generally make your life a million times easier when you are
doing simple things (like writing READMEs for github). Since
they are static things though (except when positioning html
elements with css), they are not really within the scope of
this conversation.

So, back to languages. For someone who is wanting to learn
the basic concepts of programming languages I would suggest
starting with either Ruby or Python. (With a personal, whol)
